# Prerequisites
* #### Python
* #### Tesseract
## Tesseract
* Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize more than 100 languages "out of the box".
* Tesseract supports various output formats: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV. The master branch also has experimental support for ALTO (XML) output.

In order to obtain reasonable results, you need to supply images that are cleanly pre-processed and crisp.
  ###### Recommendations:
    1) Use images with high resolution and DPI possible.
    2) Make sure that the text is clearly visible and with no pixelations or deformations.
